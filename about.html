			  Hey folks, my name is Nathan (Nate) and I'm from East Texas and 
			  have a twin brother who is in this class as well!  I am studying 
			  computer science and have been a climbing guide, a risk analyst 
			  for eBay, and a slow to finish student. I generally love to do 
			  anything on a computer, in the river fly fishing, or on the 
			  mountain climbing. Oh, I'm also engaged and will be getting 
			  married 10/11/2014 to an amazing woman!

			  <h3 align = "center">Greg Garner</h3>
			  Hi my name is Greg Garner, I was born in Dallas Texas and moved to 
			  St. George Utah in 1972 where I found a love for the outdoors. I 
			  enjoy fishing, water/snow skiing, camping, and hiking. I also love
			  to play all types of music, with my instrument of choice being the
			  guitar, with good ole rock and roll my favorite to play. My favorite 
			  bands are Boston and VanHalen, and for a great guitar instrumental 
			  anything by Andy McKee. I have been married for 33 years to a 
			  wonderful women who is a Registered Nurse. She has blessed me 
			  with 4 of the best children ever along with an unbelievable life 
			  so far. I also now have 3 grand children with one on the way. 
			  Looking forward to many more family gatherings as our family grows. 
			  After being a transmission re-builder for 28 years and a downward 
			  slump in the aftermarket and rebuilding business I decided to 
			  tackle the computer science industry and learn the skill of 
			  programing. This has been a tough but rewarding opportunity to 
			  learn this new skill, and I anticipate great job opportunities 
			  once completing the 2 year degree offered here at SLCC with a 
			  possibility of moving on to obtain a bachelors from Weber State 
			  extension program at SLCC.

			  <h3 align = "center">Michael Brown</h3>
			  My name is Michael Brown, and I have lived in Utah for my entire 
			  life. I did, however, live in southern Texas and as a result speak 
			  fluent Spanish! I grew up in a technical home and have been around 
			  computers my entire life. I have become  familiar with programming 
			  and it's concepts by a lot of hard work and self-learning. I have 
			  come to learn that programming is a difficult skill to learn, but 
			  the rewards are virtually limitless. I hope that by reviewing the 
			  information on this site, that you will better understand the 
			  fundamentals of programming and gain a love for it like I have.
